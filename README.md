<h2>DEEP LEARNING MODEL OF COSWARA PROJECT'S COVID-19 DATASET</h2>
<p>
  This work conforms to an assignment whose objective is to build a deep learning model using the Coswara project's Covid-19 dataset. I have focussed mainly on data analysis and data processing rather than building a very well performing (properly tuned) deep learning model solely to confirm the repeated statement (by many data scientists) that a well studied and processed dataset can often override the requirement of hypertuning of machine learning models. And they are right!!

<p>
  The project has been dealt as an "effective" binary (2-class) classification problem and as an "effective" multiclass (4-class) problem. The origianl problem pertains to a 7-class classification problem. The reduction logic as well as other details are present in the respective notebooks.
